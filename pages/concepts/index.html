                <p>Concept Art is sketches sometimes done using pen and markers, sometimes digitally, to give the director
                    of a movie how various things will look like, and a way to explore different ideas before producton begin.</p>
                <p>It's the point where the directors and writers have an idea of how the
                    story should proceed, but don't know how the various characters, vehicles, buildings and environments will look like.</p>
                <p>It's like the ideation stage of UX.</p>

                <p>What I love about concept art is that it's the point at which the story is mostly complete, but the writer isn't sure what
                    this universe will look like. Concept art gives us a wonderful opportunity to explore that universe.</p>
                <p>When I'm creating
                    concept art, my mind is open to ideas that I would not have thought about before. You're willing to explore ideas that
                    are crazy or out there. The end result is an outpouring of creativity far greater than any step in the design process.</p>
                <p>
                    It is exhilarating, challenging, exasperating, but most of all, a blast.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>This is one of my favorite steps in the design process. This is the point where you start to explore ideas, see what sticks.
                    Usually even when designing for my own stories, I'll put some constraints and rules, which helps to ground the ideas
                    and give them shape.</p>

                <p>I like to research real world objects, peoples, machines and things when exploring different ideas for my concept art. It keep the ideas grounded and believable.</p>

            <p>Viktor was a Russian author living in Illinois. He wanted a set of concept art with a Soviet theme, sort of like
                what would happen if the Russian space race from the 50s and 60s had extended into the future. What would
                Russian ships look like? For reference, I looked at various articles about actual Russian space technologies,
                both current and future, trying to understand the unique designs and patterns that would make my concepts look
                distinctly Russian.</p>
