                <h3>UX Helps You Understand Your Users</h3>

                <p>It's very important to understand how users interact with your system. Your users are the lifeblood of your company. Whether
                    they are your  employees or your customers, how they feel affects their engagement, their productivity and their willingness
                    to spend more money with your company. UX aims to understand this by using a variety of techniques:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Sifting through analytics data</li>
                    <li> Interviewing users ideally in their environment (especially for employees, as understanding where they are using
                        the software can affect what platform and how the interface works)</li>
                    <li> Observing users in action, either by shadowing them as they use the software, or doing usability testing</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>UX Helps you strategically allocate resources</h3>

                <p>When you're a company, your resources are limited. Developing new features or upgrading existing ones  And hiring additional
                    resources costs money and time. UX helps to understand where those resources can be best allocating by understanding how users
                    interact with your software or system and how that affects engagement, profits and other factors.</p>
