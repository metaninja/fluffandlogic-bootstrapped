                <p>I love science fiction. Growing up with Omni magazine, aviation history books, books by authors like Isaac
                    Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, and fantasy and science fiction stories like Thundercats and He-Man,
                    sooner or later I was going to try writing my own stories.</p>

                <p>When I was a child, I would write short stories first with pen and paper, and then with a mechanical
                    typewriter. More recently, I started writing again as a way to teach myself how to write good content. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>There are two stories that I've been working on for a very
                    long time, that I hope to eventually publish: Jade Moon, a story I started thinking about about 7 years ago, and
                    The Millennium War, a story I've been working on for almost 2 decades!</p>

            <h3>Empire Dawn</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Empire Dawn is set in the far future, where empires from our past have made a resurgence. Empires in this time
                span tens of thousands of stars.</p>

            <p>The kingdom of the Holy Church is struggling to fight a rebellion lead by an
                enigmatic and mysterious heretic, complicated by its vast size and the sheer bureaucratic nightmare of managing
                an empire with tens of thousands of stars, and possibly twice that many planets. The Egpytian empire is
                celebrating the ascension of it's newest Pharaoh, King Ramses the Eternal. The Muslim empire has finally
                achieved peace and stability after centuries of civil war fomented by ancient tribal allegiances. Under the
                rule of the Khalifa, the empire is united and its people hungry for more worlds to colonize and settle on for
                their ever growing families.</p>

            <p>Each empire has its own reasons for wanting to expand beyond their current borders. And the few independent
                worlds are worried whether the fragile truce that the empires promised to keep will hold when as their hunger
                for new worlds grows. After thousands of years of peace, the galaxy is on the verge of renewed war, unless those
                who want peace at all costs can find a way to succeed.</p>

            <p>Jade Moon is set on another world populated by humans using technology that's at a 1950s-60s level. So no plasma
                rifles and faster than light hyperdrive engines. The goal was to reduce the time it would take to illustrate and
                write this story by firmly limiting the setting so it would be easier to finish the story. Although, 8 years
                later, I'm still only halfway through writing the draft, so maybe it didn't help :-).</p>

            <p>A retired army commander is ordered to take one last mission to find a missing team of scientists from the first
                mission to his world’s moon. Except the moon is green and lush with dense forests and the team he is sent with
                is an odd compliment for a rescue mission. What could his superiors be hiding?</p>

            <p>A child of Earth, Alina, is stranded far away from home with only a robotic armor that calls itself Navigator
                for a companion. Surrounded by both familiar humans speaking an ancient language that no one has spoken in
                thousands of years and aliens who seem to either fear, mistrust her or want her dead, she must find her way back
                to Earth and along the way unravel the mystery of her strange companion, the zealots that are hunting her, and
                the mistrust of humans that seem a common thread in our galaxy beyond our own star system.</p>

            <p>Jonathan Night had an ordinary life. A wife he loved, a young child, pleasant job, when he finds himself

                in a world that appears to be a darker, more sinister version of his own, Jonathan must fight the mob, and hope
                that he can eventually find a way home. And hope he can remain the good man he was before he came here.</p>
